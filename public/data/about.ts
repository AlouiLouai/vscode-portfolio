    "I'm a mid-level full-stack JavaScript developer with 3+ years of experience building scalable web applications. While my core strengths are in JavaScript (Node.js, React, Next.js, NestJS), I've recently been working with Python and Flask in a hedge fund environment—diving deep into data-heavy, high-performance systems.\n\nMy passion lies in blending backend efficiency with frontend elegance, often experimenting with cutting-edge AI tools to push project capabilities even further. Whether I’m orchestrating microservices with Kafka, integrating LangChain or Azure AI for smarter apps, or designing scalable architectures using Docker and n8n, I always aim to build tech that’s fast, smart, and future-ready.\n\nCurrently exploring new job opportunities where I can contribute to impactful products, deepen my backend/AI expertise, and grow within a collaborative, ambitious team.",
